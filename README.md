This repository contains the main work for the exam of "Embedded Digital Controllers", performed @ Universit√† degli Studi di Salerno. The PDF file cointains information about all the work performed for this project, including:

1. electric motor characterization;
2. MIL, SIL and PIL validation;
3. direct coding/implementations for the PID system, on the STM32F401RE microcontroller;
4. various information regarding the hardware.

All the work has been done using Matlab/Simulink, using various tool available, and the STM32Cube IDE.
